## **Investigation Summary: Mini Poster Session**

**Overview:** Students create a poster based on their exploration of different parts of a SNR, or different SNR, and share these with others in order to spark the generation of interesting questions which can be observed and answered by participants for their independent investigations.

- Each group uses a whiteboard and some printed material to post on it (i.e. spectrum plots and overplots of subregions, and 3 color X-ray images) to create their "poster."
- Each group chooses two different regions (red and blue) **or** two different SNR (if completed in activity 5) to compare.
- Each group reports on and compares "standard properties" 
    - Angular size / linear size / distance / age or velocity estimate.
    - True color X-ray image.
    - Spectrum comparison (overplot) of different parts of the remnant (or different remnants).
    - Chart of comparison, including identification of elemental lines in each part (i.e. composition).
    - Tell the story of how light is produced in each region, using a diagram.
    - Develop a model for what is different about the matter in each region, which explains your observations. 
        - For these explanations, use the following words: "atom," "electron," "energy level," "energy level "jump" or "fall", "photon," "photon energy," "interstellar dust," "luminosity," "intensity," "spectrum," "detector."
    - "Example mini-poster" given to students as a template: ({{% resource_link "dedbc8d6-b095-483e-89fb-2a1054a9b809" "instructor example poster" %}}).
- Students then roam to other posters, and ask clarifying questions about the comparisons of other groups
- If students have examined more than just Cas A, structured discussion at the poster session can result from the following task that each student must complete.
- Identify one difference between your own group's SNR and another group's SNR, and give a basic model (explanation) to explain that difference, in writing.
- As a result of their discussions, students generate questions about SNR, which are shared, and saved as ideas for the SNR investigation project that will be undertaken by groups later.

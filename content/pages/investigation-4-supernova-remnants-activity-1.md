## **Motivating Observations/Questions About Explosions**

**Overview:** Students observe terrestrial explosions, and generate questions about how they are similar to and different from supernova explosions.

**Physical resources:** None

**Electronic resources: cannon video, X-ray image of Cas A, Cas A radio movie, images of various SNRs**

- Students observe images or movies of "exploding" things here on Earth and in space:
    - X-ray light image of [Cas A](http://chandra.harvard.edu/photo/2006/casa/)
    - [Slow motion explosion of a cannon](http://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_embedded&v=JEpNlv80qx4)
- Students record observations about each, and share important similarities, differences, and questions raised.
- All students read supernova "expert group" wiki to gain some familiarity with SNR.
- {{% resource_link "c7c9e066-666d-4623-a59d-580df3204949" "Show grid of 3-color X-ray images of many different supernova remnants, snrs (PDF)." %}}
- Students record similarities/differences/questions on board. Possible questions:
    - **Why** would something astronomical blow up? (Could motivate review of end of stellar lifetime!)
    - How could you tell what **kind** of explosion made this?
    - What used to be there before the explosion?
    - What will it look like in the future?
    - How fast does the expansion take place?
- Discussion of relative sizes in the galaxy, including a mathematical method of how to compare the sizes of objects

**Teacher tips/tricks:**

- Try to steer questions / observations toward those things students can actually observe, given their CAI experience: flux, angular size, color, spectrum, etc.

**Assessment ideas:** None

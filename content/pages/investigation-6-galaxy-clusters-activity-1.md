## **Introduction to Galaxies**

**Overview:** Students examine visible and X-ray light images of galaxies to motivate questions about them.

**Physical resources:** None

**Electronic resources:** Galaxy Zoo Web site, images of spiral and elliptical galaxies.

**Instructor gives general introduction to galaxies:**

- Typical radius = 50,000 light years = 4.5 x 10<sup>20</sup> meters
- If a galaxy was shrunk to the size of a CD (which is approximately the right shape, 100 times wider than it is thick), where would the next galaxy be located? 20 "galaxy diameters" away
- Typically, galaxies contain about 200 billion (2 x 10<sup>11</sup> stars)

**Comparing and contrasting properties of galaxies:**

- Challenge: Students complete tutorial and classify galaxies using "citizen science" Web site Galaxy Zoo ([Galaxy Zoo](http://www.galaxyzoo.org/), click "How to Take Part" to enter the tutorial).
- Focus question: Describe differences between elliptical and spiral galaxies in visible light, using the words "flux," "color," "angular width," "angular separation."
- Challenge: Make true color X-ray and false color visible and X-ray light images of an elliptical and spiral galaxy (half the class each).
- Spiral galaxy: M74 (obsid 2057), distance ~ 32 x 10<sup>6</sup> light years ([X-rays Signal Presence of Elusive Intermediate-Mass Black Hole](http://chandra.harvard.edu/press/05_releases/press_032205.html)).
- Alternate spiral: M81 (obsid 5943, examined as AGN example in {{% resource_link "ab202ddb-ee90-4d9c-b053-38d8ff2b5ae8" "Investigation 2" %}}), distance ~ 11 x 10<sup>6</sup> light years ([Black Holes Have Simple Feeding Habits](http://chandra.harvard.edu/press/08_releases/press_061808.html)).
- Elliptical galaxy: NGC 0507 (obsid 317), distance ~ 234 x 10<sup>6</sup> light years ([NASA's Chandra Finds Black Holes Stirring Up Galaxies](http://chandra.harvard.edu/press/06_releases/press_011006.html)).
- Students should make complete descriptions of the differences between their galaxy, as seen in X-ray and visible light, using the same words as above.
- Students should switch notebooks with a partner who examined the other kind of galaxy, and then discuss the important differences, to be shared on the whiteboard with the entire class.

**Wrap up discussion:**

- Discuss possible models that could explain these observations (colorful XRB point sources in spiral, no AGN at center of M74, but strong AGN possibility in elliptical NGC 0507, smoothly distributed X-ray light indicates hot gas inside and surrounding the elliptical galaxy).
- Students generate questions they have about galaxies, and share on the whiteboard.

**Teacher tips/tricks:**

- Could have students examine other ranges of light energy for a single galaxy, beyond visible and X-ray light. Link to Chandra information about Sombrero galaxy in IR, visible, and X-ray light.
- If crunched for time, students could also investigate the difference between X-ray and visible light images of galaxy **clusters**, as outlined in activity 4 below.

**Assessment ideas:**

- Which would you say is "closer together," a galaxy and 3 nearest neighbor galaxies, or a star and its 3 nearest neighbor stars? (Absolute distance is smaller for stars, but relative distance (i.e. compared to the size of the object) is smaller for galaxies.)
- Some astronomers say "looking at only visible light from an object is like listening to just the string section playing a piece of orchestra music." Why would they say this?
- If galaxies are made of stars, why do they look fuzzy and not like a bunch of dots? (issues of resolutionâ€“could have them calculate the angular size of one star at the distance to one of these galaxies).

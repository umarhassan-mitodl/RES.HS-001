## **Blackbody Properties**

**Overview:** Students discover that they can determine sizes of stars, if they are modeled accurately by blackbodies.

- Lecture Tutorials on Introductory Astronomy (Adams, et al.): Tutorial on blackbody properties: Students read and complete the hot plate questions and luminosity questions, continuing to Part II about stars and the HR diagram.
- Introduce the HR diagram with the sizes of stars represented. 
- Introduce the relation for a spherical blackbody: L= sigma \* T4 \* 4pi \* R<sup>2</sup>, which relates the luminosity (L in watts = joules/sec), temperature (T, in Kelvin) and radius of the spherical blackbody (R in meters). Sigma= Stefan-Boltzmann constant = 5.67 x 10<sup>\-8</sup> Joules / (seconds x meters<sup>2</sup> x Kelvin<sup>4</sup>) 
    - Image of notes about this relationship: ({{% resource_link "d31ab63f-bc64-41a0-bd74-75192d4b6924" "HR diagram example" %}}, {{% resource_link "3ea3442f-55ca-4cfb-9763-5c7b19f58ed2" "LTR relationship" %}})

**Teacher tips/tricks:**

- Timing: about 1 hour for lecture-tutorial alone

**Assessment:**

- Compare temperatures and/or sizes of other pairs of objects on HR diagram.
- Ask students to read off properties of selected stars on the HR diagram.

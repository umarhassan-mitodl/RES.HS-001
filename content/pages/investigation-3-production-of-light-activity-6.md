## **Wrap-Up Project: Writing about an Argument**

For the case of the neutron star RBS 1223, present the answer to these questions on the whiteboard:

1. What makes you believe that the blackbody model curve is a better fit to the observed spectrum?
2. Predict properties of this NS, given distance of 1200 parsecs: Flux (ergs/cm<sup>2</sup>/sec), Temperature (in Kelvin, using conversion of 1 keV= 1.1 x 10<sup>7</sup> K), Luminosity (ergs/sec)
3. Compare to another, hypothetical, neutron star with same temperature (1.13 x 10<sup>6</sup> K), but higher luminosity (1.5 x 10<sup>33</sup> ergs/sec). How is this hypothetical star different from RBS1223? Can you say anything about their relative size? (luminosity is 50% more, and temperature is the same, so the hypothetical star would have a larger radius.Â

**Teacher tips/tricks:**

- If more time or a more challenging wrap up is desired, have students predict the luminosity of the hypothetical star: give students values for distance (= 1470 pc, further), temperature (= 1.13 x 10<sup>6</sup> K, same) and flux (= 5.5 x10<sup>\-12</sup> ergs/cm<sup>2</sup>/sec, same) for hypothetical neutron star. Via calculation, students obtain the luminosity given above (= 1.5 x 10<sup>33</sup> ergs/sec, about 1.5 times the luminosity of RBS 1223)
- Also, with extra time or for students done early, have them calculate the radii of the two neutron stars, using the relation L = sigma \* T4 \* 4 \* pi \* R<sup>2</sup>. Hypothetical star radius will only be larger by a factor of 1.13, or 13% ( = square root of 1.5)

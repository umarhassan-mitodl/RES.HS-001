  image-alt: A graph showing how interstellar dust affects X Rays. The top line is
    for almost no dust, and then the lines further down represent the low, medium
    and highest amount of dust that is likely to be between Chandra and most X-ray
    sources. The Y-axis essentially represents the amount of light which is able to
    pass through the dust. In other words, the more dust, the less likely we are to
    collect low energy photons.
